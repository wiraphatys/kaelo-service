## üé≠ Background Story

### The Genesis
In late 2024, a team of Computer Engineering students at a prestigious Thai university faced a common challenge in their IoT Hardware course - creating a meaningful project that went beyond basic sensor readings. The inspiration struck during a particularly hot Bangkok afternoon when the air conditioning in their lab malfunctioned, causing expensive equipment to overheat.

### The Vision
The team realized that many critical environments - from server rooms to laboratories, from greenhouses to storage facilities - lacked intelligent monitoring systems that could provide early warnings before problems escalated. They envisioned a system that would be:

- **Proactive**: Detect issues before they become critical
- **Accessible**: Send alerts directly to smartphones via Telegram
- **Scalable**: Handle multiple locations and devices
- **Reliable**: Work 24/7 without human intervention

### The Name
"KAELO" was chosen as a play on words - combining "Care" and "Hello" - representing the system's caring nature and its friendly approach to keeping users informed about their environment.

### The Journey
What started as a simple temperature monitoring project evolved into a comprehensive environmental surveillance system. The team faced challenges with:

- **Real-time Data**: Moving from polling to optimized Firebase subscriptions
- **Alert Fatigue**: Implementing smart throttling to prevent notification spam
- **Hardware Integration**: Supporting multiple sensor types and devices
- **Production Deployment**: Creating a robust, containerized service

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend Service (Go)
- **Framework**: Pure Go with structured architecture
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database for real-time synchronization
- **Messaging**: Telegram Bot API for instant notifications
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with multi-stage builds
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging with Zap

### Hardware Platform
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 with WiFi connectivity
- **Sensors**: Temperature+Humidity, MQ135 Gas sensor, Flame sensor (KY-026), Vibration switch (KY-002)
- **Actuators**: Active buzzer (KY-012)
- **Communication**: JSON over Firebase Realtime Database
- **Power**: USB or battery-powered options

### Data Flow
1. ESP32 sensors collect environmental data every few seconds
2. Data is pushed to Firebase Realtime Database with timestamps
3. KAELO backend service polls Firebase for new data
4. Anomaly detection algorithms analyze incoming data
5. Alerts are sent via Telegram and hardware notification systems
6. All events are logged for monitoring and debugging
